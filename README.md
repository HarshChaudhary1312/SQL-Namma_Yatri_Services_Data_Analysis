## Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- `Namma Yatri (XLSX).xlsx`: Contains datasets used in the analysis.
- `NammaYatri_Data_Analysis.sql`: SQL queries used to extract and manipulate data.
- `Dashboard-Namma_Yatri_Data_Analysis(Power BI).pdf`: Power BI files for visualization.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Data Analysis
The analysis covers the following aspects:
- Trips: Analyzing trip data including durations, average durations, and average chances of booking confirmed and ended.
- Searches: Understanding search patterns and trends.
- Driver Earnings: Investigating driver earnings and factors influencing them.
- Location of Bookings: Geospatial analysis of booking locations.

## SQL Queries
The `NammaYatri_Data_Analysis.sql` directory contains SQL queries used to extract and manipulate data from the database. These queries are organized based on their respective analysis topics.

## Power BI Dashboard
The `Dashboard-Namma_Yatri_Data_Analysis(Power BI).pdf` directory contains Power BI files for visualizing the analyzed data. The dashboard provides interactive visualizations for better understanding and interpretation of the insights gained from the analysis.

## How to Use
To replicate the analysis and visualize the data using Power BI, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Set up a local database with the provided datasets or use your own data.
3. Execute the SQL queries to extract relevant data for analysis.
4. Open the Power BI files in the `power_bi_dashboard/` directory and connect them to your database.
5. Explore the visualizations and customize them as needed.
